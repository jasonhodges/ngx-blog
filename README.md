## ngx blog
=======
starter project for an Angular 2+ blog
 
The idea behind this project is to create a personal, blog-type starter site. 
 
Once finished and ready for consumption, the starter will allow any user to quickly get their site up and running with Angular, markdown parsing, publishing, building, etc. The goal is to minimize the user configuration required while leaving plenty of custiomizing.
